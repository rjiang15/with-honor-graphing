# Congress Voting Patterns Analysis Tool

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze voting patterns and collaboration among members of the U.S. Congress. A lot of the documentation will assume we are dealing with the House of Representatives, but Senate data should work too (untested though). By leveraging advanced data visualization techniques and network analysis, this tool provides insightful visual representations of voting similarities and cross-party collaborations. Users can upload CSV files containing voting and membership data, and the tool consolidates this information to generate detailed graphs and statistics that highlight key voting trends.

## Features

- **Voting Patterns Analysis**: The application processes data to identify instances where members of Congress vote against their party's typical stance, identifying them as "collaborators."
- **Collaboration Index**: This unique metric quantifies the extent to which representatives vote across party lines, crucial for understanding bipartisan cooperation within Congress.
- **Detailed Statistics**: The tool provides comprehensive statistics on voting patterns, including the percentage of roll numbers with significant cross-party voting activity.
- **Visualizations**: Users can create interactive network graphs illustrating voting similarities among representatives, with nodes representing members of Congress and edges indicating voting alignments. The tool also supports the export of these graphs as PNG images.
